 <!-- Abstract -->
  <section id="abstract">
    <p>
      This document lays out the conformance criteria for service providers who wish to be recognized by the 
      Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) as Tracing service providers.
    </p>
  </section>
  <!-- Intro -->
  <section>
    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The publication is intended for <b>Tracing</b> service providers who wish to implement 
        Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) credentialing in an Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)-compliant way under 
        the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (<a>DSCSA</a>). Implementation means the integration of OCI trust architecture 
        components with the Tracing system. <br><br>
        This document provides a specification of the Conformance Criteria for a Tracing provider. 
        For a general introduction to OCI, please refer to our <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/getting-started">Getting Started guide</a> or the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative website</a>.

    <h2>General Terms and Abbreviations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>Credential</dfn>: A digital assertion containing a set of claims (e.g. about a State license or FDA Establishment Identifier) made by an entity about itself or another entity. Credentials are a subset of identity data.</li>
          <li><dfn>corrUUID</dfn> (Correlation Universally Unique Identifier): A unique ID for a set of transactions. In the context of Tracing, the TIRequestID and TIResponseID take the form of corrUUIDs.</li>
          <li><dfn>Digital wallet</dfn>: Software that manages enterprise identities via decentralized identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials.</li>
          <li><dfn><abbr title="Drug Supply Chain Security Act">DSCSA</abbr></dfn> (Drug Supply Chain Security Act): An act of the U.S. Congress. Find more information on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa">FDA website</a>.</li>           
          <li><dfn>Verifiable Presentation</dfn>: A digital presentation that is created from Verifiable Credential data in order to be shared with a verifier.</li>        
        </ul>
  </section>       
  <!-- T&C -->  
  <section>
    <h2>Wallet API Integration and Authentication</h2>
    <p>In accordance with the <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Digital-Wallet-Conformance-Criteria/latest/">Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria</a>, all <a>digital wallets</a> provide the same APIs for creating and verifying ATP <a>Credential</a> Presentations. Tracing providers integrate these APIs in accordance with the latest <em>OCI Interoperability Profile</em>. Refer to the published <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/resources">OCI resources</a> for details.<br><br>
      Tracing providers SHALL only integrate wallets that are compliant with the OCI digital wallet conformance criteria. The OCI conformance programme lays out how compliance with the OCI digital wallet conformance criteria will be verified and compliant wallets made well-known to the Tracing provider. <br><br>      
      Tracing providers SHALL integrate the digital wallet REST APIs by establishing a secure authentication via OAuth2.0 bearer token and encryption via SSL TLS v1.2+. The Connection SHALL be REST on HTTPS.<br><br>
      Tracing providers SHALL have measures in place to facilitate their access to the following wallet APIs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generating a <a>Verifiable Presentation</a> API (refer to <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Digital-Wallet-Conformance-Criteria/latest/#api-to-generate-a-verifiable-presentation-of-atp-credential">OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria</a>)</li>
        <li>Verify a signed <a>Verifiable Presentation</a> API  (refer to <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Digital-Wallet-Conformance-Criteria/latest/#api-to-verify-verifiable-presentation-of-atp-credential">OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria</a>)</li>
      </ul>
  </section> 
  <section>
    <h2>Mapping of each Tracing customer to their respective digital wallet</h2>
    <p>Given that Tracing providers serve multiple customers, it may be expected that providers will need to integrate one or more digital wallet solutions. The mapping of each Tracing customer to the respective customer digital wallet account is a critical factor in a secure integration.<br><br>
      When a Tracing provider is connected to a wallet solution with one or multiple customer accounts, the Tracing provider SHALL ensure that each of its internal customer accounts has the ability to designate and maintain its digital wallet solution. The association of a Tracing customer to a digital wallet will be maintained through customer configuration. 
      </p>
  </section> 
  <section>
    <h2>Wallet Interoperability & Integration Testing</h2>
    <p>There are multiple potential Tracing-wallet combinations. Interoperability testing supports the frictionless implementation of technology standards in the context of identity and trust as an ecosystem solution.  OCI recommends use of its OCI’s published test case resources when designing interoperability test activities. Each OCI Digital Wallet provider SHALL ensure interoperability with other OCI Digital Wallets enabling Tracing solution providers to seamlessly integrate with OCI Digital Wallet providers according to the APIs defined in the OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria.</p>
  </section> 
  <section>
    <h2>End-to-end Correlation</h2>
    <p>The Tracing provider SHALL send the TIRequestID or TIResponseID (as applicable) in the Tracing request and response messages to the digital wallet (via the Wallet API) as the <a>corrUUID</a> when requesting the digital wallet to generate a verifiable presentation of a verifiable credential. Refer to <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Digital-Wallet-Conformance-Criteria/latest/#api-to-generate-a-verifiable-presentation-of-atp-credential">OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria</a> for Generating a <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Tracing-Conformance-Criteria/latest/index.html#dfn-verifiable-presentation">Verifiable Presentation API</a>.
</p>
  </section> 
  <section>
    <h2>Latency Improvements</h2>
    <p>The Tracing and Digital Wallet integration design SHOULD be optimized to minimize latency.</p>
  </section> 
  <section>
    <h2>Audit Logs & Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Tracing SHALL maintain auditable logs of <a>Verifiable Presentation</a> generation and verification requests and responses.</p>
